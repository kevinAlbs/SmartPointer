Stupid Smart Pointers
---------------------

A proof-of-concept smart pointer library in C.

This code is non-portable, and was tested on x86 Ubuntu 16.04 with gcc 5.4.0. It is intended to be as simple as possible.

See [the article|http://blog.kevinalbs.com/stupid_smart_pointers] for an explanation of how it works.
